# Mutualism
Modeling a mutualistic microbial system


This project concerns the modeling of a microbial system that consists of two mutualistic cross-feeding species. 

The code <main.py> creates time traces of the different equations. 

The class <parameters.py> creates an object defined by its parameters, which can be suggested optionally.

The file <dynamics.py> contains code to solve the differential equations

The files <bifurcation.py> contains code to perform a bifurcaiton analysis
