# Mutualism
Modeling a mutualistic microbial system that can display bistability.
A detailed description of the equations and dynamics, can be found in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63772-4

This project concerns the modeling of a microbial system that consists of two mutualistic cross-feeding species. 

The code <main.py> creates time traces of the different equations. 

The class <parameters.py> creates an object defined by its parameters, which can be suggested optionally.

The file <dynamics.py> contains code to solve the differential equations

The file <bifurcation.py> contains code to perform a bifurcation analysis
